# What is Flask?

Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug
and Jinja2.  It's intended for getting started very quickly
and was developed with best intentions in mind.


# What do I need?

All dependencies are installed by using `pip install Flask`.
We encourage you to use a virtualenv. Check the docs for
complete installation and usage instructions.
