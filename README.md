# What is Flask?

Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug
and Jinja2.  It's intended for getting started very quickly
and was developed with best intentions in mind.


# What do I need?

All dependencies are installed by using `pip install Flask == 0.10.1`. (The Version is important)
We encourage you to use a virtualenv. `create virtualenv`
Next, check youre config by using `echo FLASKR SETTINGS = config.cfg`
We need a Database, the created file schema.sql import into flaskr.db: `sqlite3 /tmp/flaskr.db < schema.sql`
Let's start! `python flaskr.py` (Open the URL in youre Browser)
